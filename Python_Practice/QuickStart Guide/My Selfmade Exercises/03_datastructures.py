# Data Structures Practice Problems

# 1. Create and print a list containing five different fruits.
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"]
# Print the list

# 2. Add an item to an existing list and remove another.
fruits.append("Fig")
fruits.remove("Banana")
# Print updated list

# 3. Write a script to find the largest number in a list.
numbers = [10, 30, 25, 40, 15]
# Find and print the largest number

# 4. Create and manipulate a tuple with mixed data types.
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.14)
# Perform some operations

# 5. Explain the difference between a list and a tuple.
# Your answer here

# 6. Create a set and demonstrate set operations (union, intersection).
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
# Perform union and intersection

# 7. Write a script to count the frequency of each character in a string.
my_string = "banana"
# Count and print character frequencies

# 8. Create a dictionary mapping countries to their capitals.
countries = {"USA": "Washington D.C.", "Japan": "Tokyo", "France": "Paris"}
# Print the dictionary

# 9. Write a program to reverse the order of items in a list.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Reverse and print

# 10. Demonstrate the use of nested dictionaries.
nested_dict = {"dict1": {"key1": 1, "key2": 2}, "dict2": {"key3": 3, "key4": 4}}
# Access and print an element
