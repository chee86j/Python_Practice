Installing Python on your Windows 10 PC and setting it up with 
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a great way to start working on 
Python projects. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

    Install Python:
        Visit the official Python website.
        Download the latest version for Windows.
        Run the installer. Ensure to check the box that says 
        "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".

    Verify Python Installation:
        Open Command Prompt (you can search for cmd in the 
        Windows search bar).
        Type python --version and press Enter. If Python is 
        installed correctly, it should display the version number.

    Set Up Python in VS Code:
        Open VS Code.
        If you haven't already, install the Python extension for 
        VS Code. You can find it in the Extensions view 
        (Ctrl+Shift+X) by searching for 'Python'.
        Once the extension is installed, VS Code should 
        automatically detect the Python interpreter you installed.

    Create and Run a Python File:
        In VS Code, open a new file and save it with a .py 
        extension, for example, fizzbuzz.py.
        Copy the FizzBuzz code into this file.
        To run the file, you can right-click in the editor 
        and select "Run Python File in Terminal", or use 
        the play button in the top right corner of the editor.

    Observing the Output:
        The output should appear in the terminal at the 
        bottom of the VS Code window.
