# DESCRIPTION:
# Your function takes two arguments:

# current father's age (years)
# current age of his son (years)
# Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son 
# (or in how many years he will be twice as old). The answer is always 
# greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -----Solution 1-----Absolute difference-----
def twice_as_old(dad_years_old, son_years_old):
    return abs(dad_years_old - 2 * son_years_old)
    # 1. return absolute difference between father's age & twice son's age
    #    using abs function to return absolute value of difference
    
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -----Solution 2-----If/else While-----
