# Complete the function that calculates the area of the red square, 
# when the length of the circular arc A is given as the input. 
# Return the result rounded to two decimals.

# Note: use the Ï€ value provided in your language (Math::PI, M_PI, math.pi, etc)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -----Solution 1-----Math Module & Pi-----
from math import pi

def square_area(A):
    return round((2 * A / pi) ** 2, 2)
#   1. Import the pi value from the math module
#   2. Create a function that takes in a parameter A
#   3. Calculate the area of the square by squaring the radius of the circle `A` and 
#      multiplying it by 4
#   4. Return the area of the square rounded to 2 decimal places `round((2 * A / pi) ** 2, 2)`

#   This solution has a time complexity of O(1) since it only performs a few 
#   mathematical operations and a space complexity of O(1) since it only uses a few variables. 
#   It is the most optimal solution for this problem because it uses the pi value from the math 
#   module to calculate the area of the square exactly.

# -----Solution 2-----Math Module & Pi Alternative-----
import math
def square_area(A):
    return round((A*4/(2*math.pi))**2, 2)
#   1. Import the math module
#   2. Create a function that takes in a parameter A
#   3. Calculate the area of the square by squaring the radius of the circle `A` and 
#      multiplying it by 4
#   4. Return the area of the square rounded to 2 decimal places `round((A*4/(2*math.pi))**2, 2)`

#   This is similar to the first solution but calculates the area of the square using 
#   the formula A = (4r^2) where r = A/(2*pi). This solution has a time complexity of O(1)
#   and a space complexity of O(1) since it only uses a few variables and performs a few
#   mathematical operations. In terms of readability, this solution is slightly less readable
#   than the first solution because it uses the formula directly without explaining the
#   relationship between the radius of the circle and the area of the square.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# -----Solution 3-----Javascript Solution-----
# function squareArea(A){
#   var circum = 4 * A;
#   var radius = circum / (2 * Math.PI);
#   var area = Math.pow(radius, 2);
#   return Math.round(area*100)/100
# }

#   This is a JavaScript solution that calculates the area of the square using the formula
#   A = (4r^2) where r = A/(2*pi). It follows a similar approach to the second Python solution
#   but uses JavaScript syntax. The area is rounded to two decimal places using the Math.round
#   function. The time complexity and space complexity of this solution are O(1) since it only
#   performs a few mathematical operations and uses a few variables. This solution is equivalent
#   to the second Python solution but written in JavaScript. However it is the most readable 
#   solution because it explains the relationship between the radius of the circle and the area
#   of the square.
