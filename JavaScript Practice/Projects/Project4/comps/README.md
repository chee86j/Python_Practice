This is a React Starter Project for use in Stephen Grider's courses on Udemy.

## Project Overview

We start with a simple button component to standardize the button styling and behavior.

The Prop Names will be listed below and they will be boolean values with the purpose
of changing the button styling.:

- primary
- secondary
- success
- warning
- danger

- outline
- rounded

Of these props, only one can be true at a time. The rest will be false.
The button will be styled based on the prop that is true.
