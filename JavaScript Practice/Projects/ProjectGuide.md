# Project Guide

This guide explains what each project is meant to teach and which core ideas you should practice while completing it.

## OOP
Focus: object-oriented JavaScript patterns and how they compare.

- 01_Prototypes: How prototypal inheritance works, the prototype chain, and shared methods.
- 03_Factory_Functions: Creating objects with factory functions and closures.
- 04_Constructor_Functions: Using `function` constructors with `new`, instance vs. prototype methods.
- 05_Classes: ES6 class syntax as a clearer wrapper over prototypes.
- 06_More_Classes_Practice: Additional class exercises and method organization.
- 07_Extends_and_Super: Inheritance with `extends` and `super`, base vs. derived classes.

## Project1Calculator
Focus: DOM basics, event handling, and state in the UI.

- Build a calculator UI and wire up button clicks.
- Practice query selectors, event listeners, and updating the display.
- Keep track of current value, previous value, and chosen operation.

## Project2NavBar
Focus: responsive layout and interactive navigation.

- Build a navbar that adapts to screen size.
- Practice CSS layout (flex/grid), media queries, and toggling classes with JS.
- Learn how to structure a clean HTML/CSS/JS split for UI components.

## Project3ReactFormHandling
Focus: React component state, forms, and CRUD flows.

- Manage input state with `useState`.
- Fetch initial data and react to changes with `useEffect`.
- Pass data between components with props.
- Share data across components with `useContext`.
- Fetch, create, edit, and delete data from a JSON API.
