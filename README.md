My Python Learning Adventure

Introduction

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to learning Python! I'm currently expanding my programming 
expertise from JavaScript to Python, and this repository is where I'll be documenting my journey. I've chosen 
to follow the Programming QuickStart Guides Bundle as my primary learning resource.

Background
As a JavaScript developer, I've decided to challenge myself by diving into Python. This journey isn't just 
about learning a new language; it's about opening up new opportunities and perspectives in the world of 
programming.
Goals

    Master Python Basics: Starting with the essentials and gradually progressing to more complex topics.
    Project-Based Learning: Implementing concepts in practical, real-world applications.
    Guide-Driven Approach: Following the structured path provided by the Programming QuickStart Guides Bundle.
    AI Teaching Assist: Using the Custom 'Code Tutor' in ChatGPT4 Khanmigo Lite, by Khan Academy as a guide.
    Share My Experience: Regularly updating this repository with progress, insights, and reflections.

## Progress Log

### Start Date: January 12, 2024
- Initial Steps: Getting accustomed to Python syntax and basic constructs.
- First Milestones: Completing introductory exercises from the guide.

### Ongoing Updates
#### 1.13.2024 - 'FizzBuzz'
- Implemented the 'FizzBuzz' exercise, focusing on Python's syntax differences from JavaScript, especially in loops and conditional statements.
- Explored Python-specific features like list comprehensions and inline conditional expressions, applying them to solve the FizzBuzz problem efficiently.

#### 1.14.2024 - 'rng (Random Number Generator)'
- Developed a CLI tool in Python to generate random numbers, enhancing understanding of command-line arguments handling with the `sys` module.
- Delved into error handling in Python, learning to validate and process user input effectively.
- Gained experience with Python's `random` module for generating random numbers within user-defined ranges.

Future updates and learning milestones will be added here.


Projects

    Project 1: TBD (A simple Python project)
    Project 2: TBD (A more complex application)
    Further projects will be added as I progress.
